    <div class="is-family-secondary">Hi! My name is Lanie. I'm a devops engineer for pay, and a giant nerd for fun. I ride motorcycles, tweet about politics and tech, and draw maps of fictional places.  I have a dog named Tina (sometimes known as <a href="https://instagram.com/the.tuna.dog" target="_blank">Tuna</a>), and a cat named Tripwire. I currently live in the Seattle area with my partner, having moved here in 2020 from Chicago.</div>
